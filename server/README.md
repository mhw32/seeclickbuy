# Server 

### Installation

We recommend using a conda environment to install the dependencies. Then run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, follow the instructions in the [AI README](../ai/README.md) to install those dependencies. 
Make sure to install `seeclickbuy` as a pip package in the `ai` directory.

### Usage

To start the server in development mode:
```bash
fastapi dev main.py
```
